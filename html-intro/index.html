    <h1>I love Cooking and Baking:</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p id="content">I have been cooking and baking since childhood, but made it a career during my early adult years. I initially went to culinary
        school right after high school and pursued that career for nearly a decade.  Glad though to have left the industry and now pursue it as
        a cherished hobby.</p>
