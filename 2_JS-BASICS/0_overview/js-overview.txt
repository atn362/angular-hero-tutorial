1. JS overview
    - JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language
        - does not generate a .exe or equivalent
        - requires a "interpreter" program to run the code
        - we will be using the web browser as our interpreter
    - It's mostly used to add interactivity to websites
    - open source
    - cross platform

2. JS Specifications
    - Because its open source there are many "versions" of JS
    - To make functionality more standardized across browsers an organization called ECMA International creates
        a set of JS "rules" that interpreters should follow when executing JS files.
    - All modern browsers support ES6
        - excluding Internet Explorer (please do not use this....)

3. JS keywords
    - there are some words that are reserved for specific actions in JS
        - these words are know as "key words" or "reserved words"
        - keywords cannot be used for variable names
